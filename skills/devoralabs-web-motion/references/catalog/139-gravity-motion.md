## Implementation recipe

Integrate acceleration and stop or bounce at a defined floor.

Keep physics bounded and deterministic enough to settle; preserve keyboard alternatives.

**Starting timing:** derive motion from input velocity or the spring model; settle and stop below an explicit displacement/velocity threshold.

## Adaptation checks

End in the intended readable, interactive state. Do not retain a clipped, distorted or transparent final control.

Preserve focus, selected items and form/demo state. Respect reduced motion and stop work in hidden views.

Verify a real intermediate frame and the settled state; do not infer visible movement from a class or animation object alone.

## Demo source

[Deterministic renderer](../../assets/catalog/demo-engine.mjs): zero-based group 13, branch 8. Call `drawDemo(context, 139, normalizedTime)` on a 400 × 260 Canvas. The full source is study material; port only the selected mechanism into production.
